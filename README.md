- The following Python libraries:
  - instacapture: Core functionality for Instagram content downloading
  - requests: For HTTP requests to Instagram servers
  - pillow: Image processing for GUI (optional if using CLI only)
  - tkinter: GUI framework (comes with most Python installations, optional if using CLI only)

## üöÄ Installation and Setup

### Installing Packages
```bash
# Install required libraries
pip install instacapture requests pillow
```

### For Windows Users
1. Double-click on `InstaCapture.pyw` or `StartInstaCapture.bat` in the downloaded files.
2. Alternatively, in command prompt:
```bash
python instastalk.py        # For command-line interface
python instastalk_gui.py    # For graphical interface
```

### For macOS Users
1. Double-click on `InstaCapture.command` in the downloaded files.
   - If you encounter a permission error, run `chmod +x InstaCapture.command` in Terminal first
   - If you see a security warning that says "macOS cannot verify that this app is free from malware", you need to:
     1. Open System Preferences > Security & Privacy
     2. Click the lock icon to make changes (enter your password)
     3. Look for the message about "InstaCapture.command" was blocked and click "Open Anyway"
     4. Return to the file and double-click it again, then click "Open" when prompted
2. Alternatively, in Terminal:
```bash
python3 instastalk.py       # For command-line interface
python3 instastalk_gui.py   # For graphical interface
```

### For Linux Users
In Terminal:
```bash
python3 instastalk.py       # For command-line interface
python3 instastalk_gui.py   # For graphical interface
```

### Creating Desktop Shortcut for Easy Access
To create a desktop shortcut:
```bash
python desktop_shortcut_setup.py

*How to find the cookie value*

### Downloading Posts/Reels

1. Find the post or reel you want to download on Instagram
2. Copy the URL from your browser address bar
3. Paste the URL into InstaCapture
4. The post and all its media will be downloaded automatically

### Batch Downloading

1. Enter the username you want to batch download from
2. Choose whether to download Stories, Posts, or Both
3. Wait for the download to complete
4. All content will be organized in separate folders

### Location of Downloaded Content

All downloaded files are stored in the `instagram_content` folder:

- `instagram_content/stories/` - Downloaded stories
  - Organized by username
  - Each story has timestamp information
- `instagram_content/posts/` - Downloaded posts and reels
  - Organized by username and post ID
  - Includes JSON metadata files
- `instagram_content/profiles/` - Downloaded profile pictures
  - Organized by username

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Cookie Error" or "Unable to download stories"**
   - Make sure you've copied the entire cookie string from Instagram
   - Check that your Instagram session is still active
   - Your cookies may have expired; log out and log back into Instagram

2. **"Module not found" errors**
   - Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all dependencies
   - Make sure you're using Python 3.6 or higher

3. **GUI doesn't appear**
   - Ensure Tkinter is installed (it comes with most Python installations)
   - Try running from command line to see if there are any error messages
   - If you see an error message "Please reinstall Python with Tkinter support", follow these instructions:
     - **macOS**: Run `brew install python-tk` or `brew reinstall python`
     - **Linux (Debian/Ubuntu)**: Run `sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install python3-tk`
     - **Linux (Fedora)**: Run `sudo dnf install python3-tkinter`
     - **Windows**: Reinstall Python with Tkinter options checked. During installation, select "Customize installation" and ensure "tcl/tk and IDLE" option is selected
   - To test if Tkinter is properly installed, run: `python -c "import tkinter; tkinter._test()"`

4. **PEP 668 error when installing packages**
   - If you see an error message like "See PEP 668 for the detailed specification" when trying to install packages, this is due to Python's system protection
   - This commonly occurs on macOS with Homebrew Python 3.10+ or Linux distributions with system Python
   - Solutions:
     - Create a virtual environment first (recommended):
       ```bash
       python -m venv .venv
       source .venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
       .venv\Scripts\activate     # On Windows
       pip install pillow requests
       ```
     - Or install packages for your user only:
       ```bash
       pip install --user pillow requests
       ```
     - Or run the command directly with required packages pre-installed:
       ```bash
       python3 instastalk.py  # For CLI
       python3 instastalk_gui.py  # For GUI
       ```

5. **Permission errors on macOS/Linux**
   - Run `chmod +x InstaCapture.command` for macOS
   - Ensure you have write permissions for the destination folder
   - On macOS, if you see "macOS cannot verify that this app is free from malware", follow the steps in the Installation section to allow the app to run (using Security & Privacy settings)
